# Transition Report



## 📦 Usefulness and Transition

### Is the product complete? Which parts are done and which aren’t done?

- ✅ Completed parts:
  - Workshop creation and listing
  - Check-in tracking
  - Interfaces for students and staff
- ❌ Not completed:
  - Staff access control (staff-check) – not verified in production
  - Final testing in the production environment

**Customer's exact words:**
> "The project is actually close to being ready. Honestly, I’m not sure if the staff-check works on your side. Workshop creation should be available only for staff. It’s fine for testing purposes, but in production it must be limited to staff only."


### Is the customer using the product? How often? In what way? If not, why not?

- **Usage frequency:** Not yet
- **How they use it:** Not used yet, as the bootcamp hasn’t started
- **If not using:** The product is not in use yet because the bootcamp event has not started. In previous years, Google Sheets were used, but this time the plan is to use this system instead.

**Customer's exact words:**
> "No, because the bootcamp hasn’t started yet. In previous years, we used spreadsheets, but now I guess it will be done this way."

### Has the customer deployed the product on their side?

- ✅ Deployed: No
- 📌 Next steps for deployment:
  - Go through the README together with the team
  - Deploy the backend (should not be a problem)
  - Connect to the existing frontend infrastructure (same as the current site)

**Customer's exact words:**
> "No, but we’ll be able to if we go through the README — it’s literally our site, nothing has changed. Deploying the backend is not a problem."

### What measures are needed to fully transition the product?

- Finish the remaining fixes
- Deploy the system on the customer’s side

**Customer's exact words:**
> "Just finish these fixes and simply deploy it."

### What are the customer's plans for the product after delivery? Are they going to continue working on it? Would they like to continue collaborating with the team and on what conditions?

- Continue development internally: The customer plans to test the product during the bootcamp and possibly make their own changes if needed.
- Would like to continue collaboration: Yes, but likely only if issues arise or additional features are requested.

**Customer's exact words:**
> "We plan to test it during the bootcamp and get praise from 319. Regarding the second question: probably, if something goes wrong or we want to add something, we will do it ourselves. Third question: yes, there is an interest to collaborate."


### How to increase the chance that it’ll be useful after the final delivery?

- Apply the final fixes mentioned by the customer
- Ensure the system is stable and functional for mandatory usage
- Make deployment and usage as smooth as possible

**Customer's exact words:**
> "You just need to apply the fixes I mentioned. What does 'useful' mean — how valuable it is, or how much it will be used? If it's the former, I don't know. If it's the latter, then everyone will have to use it because they won’t have a choice."

## 📘 Customer Feedback on README

### Is everything clear? What can be improved?

- ✅ Yes (mostly clear)
- Customer comments:
  - “Everything is good, but deployment instructions are missing.”

**Customer's exact words:**
> "Everything is good, but there’s no deployment instruction."

### Are they able to launch/deploy using your instructions?
- ✅ Yes 

### What two other sections the customer would like to be included in the ReadMe?

1. **Deployment Instructions (for customer)** — _Why important:_ The customer specifically asked for clear deployment steps, as they plan to deploy the product themselves.  
   🔗 [[Direct link to README: Deployment Instructions](https://github.com/InNoHassle-Workshops-Check-In/backend/blob/main/README_DOCKER.md)]

2. **Cleanup of Unnecessary Sections (for customer)** — _Why important:_ The customer prefers a concise README focused only on what’s relevant to them (e.g., deployment), and suggested removing unrelated or overly technical parts.  
   

**Customer's exact words:**
> "Deployment, and remove the rest — I'm not interested in this, but I understand that you need it."
